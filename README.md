## Prerequisites

1. NodeJS
You'll need to have Node 14.0.0 or up. We recommend upgrading to the LTS version of NodeJS available at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). 

You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

2. Install package
## Quick Start

Install packages and dependencies from `package.json`

`$ yarn install`
`$ npm install`

### Create environment variable file
create .env file by copy it from .env.example
### Start the app

 `$ yarn start`
 `$ npm start`
